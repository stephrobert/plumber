Any shell step that runs after the checkout is a direct path to secret exfiltration. Unlike the broader dangerous-triggers check (ISSUE-802) which flags the trigger itself, this rule flags the actual exploitable combination.",
		Remediation: "Either switch to the standard `pull_request` event (runs in the fork's context, no base-repo secrets), or remove the explicit `ref:` input so `actions/checkout` falls back to the base repository's SHA.

Tools such as eslint, npm, make, gradle, pip or pytest execute attacker-controlled repository files when they run: eslint loads eslint.config.js, npm runs package.json lifecycle scripts, make runs the Makefile, pip runs setup.py, pytest loads conftest.py.
